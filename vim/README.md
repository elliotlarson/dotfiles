# Vim setup

Download/install Plug:

```bash
$ curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

After setup with vim, you still need to run the following ex command in vim to install plugins:

```bash
$ vim
:PlugInstall
```

This will download all of the plugins.
